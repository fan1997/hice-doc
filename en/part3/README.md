* CORE module

  Define the tensor structure, initial CPU/GPU device and construct basic expression template.

* LA module

  Basic math operation base on tensor, such as dot, transpose and so on.

* ML module

  Machine Learning Algorithms base on tensor.

* NN module

  Convolution operations base on tensor.
